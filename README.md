Through a meticulous examination of the current biomedical research landscape, our proposal strategically builds upon existing studies, aiming to complement and elevate ongoing efforts. Previous research successfully identified potential inhibitory molecules through QSAR models. Aligning with these achievements, our proposal takes a step further by concentrating on the identification of key molecular descriptors crucial for recognizing effective VEGFR2 inhibitors. The approach aims to deepen the understanding of specific features essential for inhibitory efficacy.
The primary objective of our project is to construct a QSAR model for predicting the inhibition activity of VEGFR2 inhibitors sourced from the ChEMBL database. The resulting QSAR model will hold the potential to assess the efficacy of novel compounds in VEGFR2 inhibition. This approach may have the potential to streamline the early phases of drug discovery for a spectrum of therapeutic applications, including anti-cancer, retinal diseases, and inflammatory diseases therapies. By saving valuable time and resources, we hope that our research contributes to the advancement of innovative and targeted medical solutions.
